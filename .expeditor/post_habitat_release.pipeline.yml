  # We build new releases of habitat/builder-worker now since they
  # pull in the new Habitat release we just created (specifically, the
  # studio and build program).
  #
  # We then promote them to the acceptance channel, from which workers
  # in our acceptance environment will update themselves. Once we try
  # building some packages in acceptance, we can unblock this pipeline
  # to have them automatically promoted to the stable channel,
  # allowing our production workers to then update.

      same packages to the stable channel, where they will be consumed
