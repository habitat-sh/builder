Work needed for the graph utility

* TODO fix flood algorithm

* TODO Figure out how to annotate package_info with buildability report
* TODO Filter rebuild set by buildable from database
* TODO filter rebuild set by buildable because of flawed deps (
I have a pinned dep, I probably need that dep in my rebuild set or risk conflict

* TODO Code cleanups
** TODO finish PackageTable refactor/cleanup
** TODO clean up PackageIdent mess (do we memoize them? Clone them everywhere? WTF)
** 

* TODO Graph representation
** TODO Investigate GraphMap and StableGraph as possible replacement
*** Question: Do the graph algorithms (tarjan_scc, toposort) work over them?
*** Question: How do they behave with subgraphs; ideally we'd like to be able to generate subgraphs with stable indicies
** TODO Investigate other graph representations

** TODO prototype efficient incremental cycle detection

** TODO enforce origin 'DAG' structure. (No cyclic dependencies of any sort between origins)

* TODO Database support
** TODO support for fetching latest of channel, both for individual packages and whole origins
Example use case: Fetch latest stable for origin core

** TODO support for fetching 'linked' plans exclusively; we shouldn't be trying to build others
Need to generate the list of packages that have linked plans and have
build enabled. Don't want to build the garbage packages

* TODO Complete basic end to end build ordering code
** TODO complete build ordering (repeated builds of components to converge)
** TODO complete package build manifest generation
To build /core/zip/16.04/gen-0
Fetch
/core/gcc/8.2.3/gen-0
/core/foo/



* TODO Misc
** TODO Code to detect and report unbuildable plans
Causes include pinned dependencies, missing deps, inter-origin cycles, other strangeness.

* TODO Prep for re-integration into builder
** TODO unify graph representations between the builder-graph CLI 
** TODO Validate builds against existing code, plan on maybe being able to run them side-by-side

* TODO Long term
** TODO retriable builds 
Identify congruent packages from previous build attempts; allow re-use
of previous partially successful build work.

** TODO conceptualize how cross origin build propagation works  
e.g. inside an origin we rebuild if anything changes, but we probably
only want to build other origins promote to stable...
