And they will linger forever

Looks like prior bug; maybe we should cancel them automagically

* TODO Next phase

** TODO Bugs
*** TODO Visibility from UI (does it work? Only when finished, not in flight) (maybe defer)

** TODO features/bigger items
*** DONE implement worker kick
   CLOSED: [2020-09-30 Wed 10:07]
*** TODO move package_ident_intern to habitat::core
*** TODO we should have a way to mandate that touched set is built even if it’s not autobuild (may require change to Unbuildable contract)
*** TODO implement cancel
*** TODO implement worker gone
*** TODO implement recovery
*** TODO figure out more about the worker to support dummy worker
*** TODO Fix worker disconnection issue
https://github.com/habitat-sh/builder/issues/1530
*** TODO Optimize SQL indices, possibly tweak calls (group_id may be valueable to work in)
*** TODO Look at take_next_job_for_target; should it be a stored proc?
    This is safe as long as we only have one thread modifying things; may be an issue with multithreaded
    scheduler, or cancel. 

** TODO Janitorial
*** TODO better debug format for manifest entries (let's see what we actually want/use)
*** TODO Error handling SchedulerDb error is bad, m'kay? (more general error cleanup needed)
*** TODO unify jobserv and db migrations
*** TODO make Group group_state typed?
   This may be difficult because the diesel annotations can't easily be put on a protobuf defined structure
   https://spectrum.chat/rust/general/storing-rust-enums-in-postgres-with-diesel~be6a432e-57b6-4313-b82d-367fbf89312d
*** TODO Look at introducing foreign key constraints

** TODO Systems work
*** TODO get new test system in AWS
*** TODO datadog worker logs (WRITE ISSUE)
** TODO Testing
*** Multiple workers
*** Non linux workers
*** Do we wire up a foo origin with dependencies but empty package builds
   Automated from core?
*** job failed needs better test
