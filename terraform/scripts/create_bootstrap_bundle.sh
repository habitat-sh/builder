# Create a tarball of all the Habitat artifacts needed to run the
# Habitat Supervisor on a system and upload it to S3. This includes
# *all* dependencies. The goal is to have everything needed to run the
# Supervisor *without* needing to talk to a running Builder.
#
# Because you have to bootstrap yourself from *somewhere* :)
#
# You must run this as root, because `hab` is going to be installing
# packages. Since it also uploads to S3, you'll probably want to run
# it with `sudo -E` if you've got your AWS creds in your environment,
# too.
#
# This generates a tar file (not tar.gz!) that has the following
# internal structure:
#
# |-- ARCHIVE_ROOT
# |   |-- artifacts
# |   |   `-- all the hart files
# |   |-- bin
# |   |   `-- hab
# |   `-- keys
# |       `-- all the origin keys
#
# Note that this script is *not* intended to be run by Terraform! It
# is closely related to the other scripts in this directory that *do*
# get run by Terraform, though, so it makes sense to keep them
# together.
